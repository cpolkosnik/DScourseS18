Replication of Source Code

1. Download source code
2. Carefully read through comments
3. Install all packages required
4. If specifically looking to analyze ExxonMobil (XOM) stock price, the code is
already completed. Just run the code.
5. If looking to replicate for different asset follow the following
instructions:
      1. Replace 'XOM' with ticker/symbol of interest in every section of
      which has the ticker, 'XOM'
      2. Within visuals for both the Random Walk and Monte Carlo Simulation,
      replace 'XOM' to represent asset ticker/symbol of interest on plots.
      3. If you want to test different probabilities, replace the current
      values with those of your interest
