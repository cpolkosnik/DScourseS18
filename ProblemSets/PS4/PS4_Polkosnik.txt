\section{Data Sources}
Some data sources I would be interested in scraping include anything that has to do with the cryptocurrency market, or the stock market. Also, I believe analyzing market sentiment using the hashtags or mentions in tweets for the coin tickers or stock tickers could be an important variable to analyze when making a trade or investment at a specific time.

\section{Questions to Answer}

\subsection{Question 6. Part 6b}
