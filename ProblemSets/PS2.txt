\section{Summary of Interests}
I have been interested in economics since I began my college career. I began investing and trading in the financial markets about three years ago. Many of the tools I use to better my investment opportunities and trading strategies are centered around basic economic principle and economic theory. In regard to data science and the reason I have decided to take this class, I hope to better my skills in the sphere of coding, as many may describe the skill today as the, "Jack of all trades".  In regard to my final project, I am debating about creating a cryptocurrency trading bot, as the volume in that specific market is extremely volatile. Having a bot auto-buy-and-sell based on the trading strategy I currently use could become very useful. I believe it will be important to understand the realm of data science, big data, machine learning, and coding for my future as an investment banker and petroleum engineer. Learning many of these skills will be my goals for the semester. These skills will set me apart from other applicants who apply for the same positions at the jobs of my choosing, providing me an advantage. Although I plan to go work for an oil company as a Petroleum Engineer when I graduate, I hope use the skills I learn in this data science course to build more efficient models in regard to oil and gas extraction. When I move to investment banking after my career in the oil field, I plan to use the skills from this class for portfolio optimization and risk management.
